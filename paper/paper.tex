% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\section{Algorithm}
\subsection{Rule Based}
We started our process with a simple rule based method for matching and another one for blocking. 


\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Table 2}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
Bucket Name&Contents\\ \hline
A&\{John A. Whipple\} \\ \hline
Adams&\{Douglas Adams, Douglas Noel Adams, John Adams Whipple\} \\ \hline
Andreas&\{Andreas Capellanus\} \\ \hline
Andrea&\{Andrea Cappellano\} \\ \hline
Cappellano&\{Andrea Cappellano\} \\ \hline
Capellanus&\{Andreas Capellanus\} \\ \hline
Douglas&\{Douglas Adams, Douglas Noel Adams\} \\ \hline
John&\{John Adams Whipple, John A. Whipple\} \\ \hline
Noel&\{Douglas Noel Adams\} \\ \hline
Whipple&\{John Adams Whipple, John A. Whipple\} \\
\hline
\label{word_table}
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

In the rule-based method, we block based on items that have one word in common. This is the simplest reasonable blocking strategy. Table \ref{word_table} illustrates what the blocking of the three names from Figure \ref{table-example} would look like. To perform the actual matching, we used three simple rules see Table 3:
\begin{enumerate}

\item If a word is unique to two items, we match them. (`John Adams Whipple' matches `John A. Whipple' since `Whipple' only apears in those two names)
\item If, when all spaces are removed, one of the items is a substring of the other, we match them. (`the flower company' matches `theflowercompany.com' since `theflowercompany' is a subset of `theflowercompany.com')
\item If we treat each name as a set of words, and one set is a subset of the other set, we match them. (`Douglas Adams' matches `Douglas Noel Adams' since \{`Douglas', `Adams'\} $\subseteq$ \{`Douglas', `Noel', `Adams'\})

\end{enumerate} 
Even using these three rules in combination resulted in too many false negatives. Therefore we decided to treat all matches resulting from any of the three rules as valid.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Rule Based}
If we treat it as a success if there is a correct match in any of the first three slots, we get an F\textsubscript{1} score of 0.7. Since the issue is mostly false negatives, and therefore even some of the first three slots were often empty, so even if we accept any of the top 1000 as a success, we get FSCORE2, not much better.
\input{siamese_exper}
\section{Conclusions}
While we have a very good machine learning based matcher, that does not appear to translate into very good blocking. We still need to explore why we only getting around 69\% of the matches in the top 40 items, when we have the positive closer than the negative in 97\% of cases.
