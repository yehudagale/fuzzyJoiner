\section{The {\secit Body} of The Paper}
Typically, the body of a paper is organized
into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
smaller sections.  The command \texttt{{\char'134}section} that
precedes this paragraph is part of such a
hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
and placement of these headings for you, when you use
the appropriate heading commands around the titles
of the headings.  If you want a sub-subsection or
smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an
asterisk to the command name.  Examples of both
numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
balance of this sample document.

Because the entire article is contained in
the \textbf{document} environment, you can indicate the
start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your
input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.
\section{Problem}
The problem we are dealing with is the fuzzy join problem. EXPAND
\section{Algorithm}
We started our process with a simple rule based method for matching and another one for blocking. We then replaced individual peices with a machine learning method and compared the preformance. In the final product we have an elegant completly machine learning based method.

\subsection{Rule-based Matching}
\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Table 1}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
Name&Match\\ \hline
Douglas Adams&Douglas Noel Adams\\ \hline
Andreas Capellanus&Andrea Cappellano \\ \hline
John Adams Whipple&John A. Whipple \\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Table 2}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
Bucket Name&Contents\\ \hline
A&\{John A. Whipple\} \\ \hline
Adams&\{Douglas Adams, Douglas Noel Adams, John Adams Whipple\} \\ \hline
Andreas&\{Andreas Capellanus\} \\ \hline
Andrea&\{Andrea Cappellano\} \\ \hline
Cappellano&\{Andrea Cappellano\} \\ \hline
Capellanus&\{Andreas Capellanus\} \\ \hline
Douglas&\{Douglas Adams, Douglas Noel Adams\} \\ \hline
John&\{John Adams Whipple, John A. Whipple\} \\ \hline
Noel&\{Douglas Noel Adams\} \\ \hline
Whipple&\{John Adams Whipple, John A. Whipple\} \\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

In the rule-based method, we block based on items that have one word in common. This is the simplest reasonable blocking strategy. Table 2 illustrates what the blocking of the three names from Table 1 would look like. Out of NUMBER1 pairs, NUMBER2 ended up in the same bucket as all their correct matches. NUMBER3 had at least one correct match in the same bucket. To perform the actual matching, we used three simple rules see Table 3:
\begin{enumerate}

\item If a word is unique to two items, we match them. (`John Adams Whipple' matches `John A. Whipple' since `Whipple' only apears in those two names)
\item If, when all spaces are removed, one of the items is a substring of the other, we match them. (`the flower company' matches `theflowercompany.com' since `theflowercompany' is a subset of `theflowercompany.com')
\item If we treat each name as a set of words, and one set is a subset of the other set, we match them. (`Douglas Adams' matches `Douglas Noel Adams' since \{`Douglas', `Adams'\} $\subseteq$ \{`Douglas', `Noel', `Adams'\})

\end{enumerate} 
Even using these three rules in combination resulted in too many false negatives. Therefore we decided to treat all matches resulting from any of the three rules as valid. If we treat it as a success if there is a correct match in any of the first three slots, we get an F\textsubscript{1} of FSCORE1. Since the issue is mostly false negatives, and therefore even some of the first three slots were often empty, so even if we accept any of the top 1000 as a success, we get FSCORE2, not much better.
\subsection{Siamese Netwok}
The first part we replaced was the matcher. To compare the two matchers we created a rule-based matcher using the rules from the rule-based system. To replace it we created a siamese network (figure 1) INSERT FIGURE 1. A Siamese network is two deep neural networks that share weights. One entity is fed into each of the two networks. The output of the two networks is fed into a final layer which determines the distance between the two outputs and accepts or rejects. Siamese networks have been shown to work well for image matching.\cite{Hasdell:Siamese} Before feeding the entities into the networks, we used Kazuma charecter embeddings to encode each entity as a vector. We trained the network on our NUMBER1*0.95 pairs and withheld NUMBER1*0.05 for testing. We chose an equal number of negitive pairs to train the model on. We chose negitive pairs that had at least one word in common with the positive ones. We found that the fscore on the training data was FSCORE3 and FSCORE4 on the test date. This was better than the rule-based matcher which had an f-score of FSCORE5.

We next approached the blocking problem with machine learning. Since the hidden layer of the siamese network is optimized for matching, it should output an embedding of the entity which has its essential qualities with regaurds to matching (figure 2). We then used an aproximate nearest neighbors algorithm to find the nearest neighbors. EXPLAIN MORE Using these techniques we can find the most similar items without needing to block at all. The problem we ran into is only PERCENT1 of the correct matches were in the 10 nearest neighbors. The problem seems to be that since we trained the model using negative pairs that have at least one word in common, it did not learn that names that are completly different should be mapped seperatly (figure 3). We could try to fix this by feeding the model better negative pairs, but we found a more elegant solution. Instead of trying to aproximate the correct location using a siamese network trained for matching, we can use a triplet loss function and teach it to maximize the distance to the closest false pair and minimize the distance to the true matches. To find these closest entities we use our charecter embedings. This allowed us to get an f-score of FSCORE6 on the training set and FSCORE7 on the test set reading the 10 closest entities. Notice that at this point we can do away with the matching algorithm alltogether. We simply use the closest entiies as our matches.
\section{Related Works}
There have been a number of attemts to solve the fuzzy join problem. Many of the attemts use varios string matching algorithms for example \cite{Wang:String}. The main issue with using string matching comparisons is that they do not work across a wide variaty of enties ASK DR. SRINIVAS. To our knowledge no serios machine learning aproach has been used for this problem. The problem of blocking has also been dealt with using MapReduce \cite{Vernica:MapReduce}. This approach requires alot of computing power and, since they use a string matching approach in the end, is hard to generalize accross many types of entities. 

\subsection{Type Changes and {\subsecit Special} Characters}
We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
the command \texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the
command \texttt{{\char'134}textbf}
and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
\texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do not
have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
Let's make this a rather short one to
see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
document class file. Take care with the use
of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
the beginning and end of
the text that is to be in the different typeface.

You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
you can find a complete list of what is
available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
User's Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\subsection{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning, clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference
proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.pdf} files to be
displayable with \LaTeX.  More details on each of these is found in the
\textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{fly}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.pdf format).}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1in]{fly}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.pdf format)
that has been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.

Note that only {\textbf{.pdf}} files were used; if you want to include
{\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats, you can use the
\texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
commands as appropriate for the different file types.

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1in,width=1in]{rosette}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.pdf format) that has
been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics{flies}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.pdf format)
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!

There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.

% ****************** APPENDIX **************************************

% Example of an appendix; typically would start on a new page
%pagebreak

\begin{appendix}
\section{PVLDB Format has  8+4 pages}
The PVLDB paper length is limited to 8 pages. You are permitted a 4 page appendix beyond these 8 pages. However, reviewers (as well as any readers) are not required to read this appendix, and the paper should be self-contained, complete and understandable within the 8 pages. Typically, it is appropriate to place proofs, algorithm pseudocode, data set descriptions, etc. in the appendix.

Any references to the appendix from the main paper should only be in the nature of "for additional detail see..". In particular, there should be nothing in the appendix that is necessary for a reader to understand the paper. This 8+4 page rule applies to both submissions and camera-ready.

\section{Final Thoughts on Good Layout}
Please restrain yourself from squeezing too much information into the first eight pages; you can use the appendix for optional proofs or details of your evaluation which are not absolutely necessary to the core understanding of your paper. This way, you can use readable font sizes in the figures and graphs, as well as avoid tempering with the correct border values, and the spacing (and format) of both text and captions of the PVLDB format (e.g. captions are bold).

At the end, please check for an overall pleasant layout, e.g. by ensuring a readable and logical positioning of any floating figures and tables. Please also check for any line overflows, which are only allowed in extraordinary circumstances (such as wide formulas or URLs where a line wrap would be counterintuitive).

Use the \texttt{balance} package together with a \texttt{\char'134 balance} command at the end of your document to ensure that the last page has balanced (i.e. same length) columns.
