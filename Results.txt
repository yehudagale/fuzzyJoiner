This is a very simple rule based method that compares the first and last word of people with names that share at least one word. It has an F-score of 0.471543859649 and runs in about 2 minutes on my machine on all 183,000 names. It runs in seconds on the 37,000 companies but has an F-score of only about 0.207

Here is another mechanism where we tokenize the words, put them into a set and check if one name is a subset of the other. It has a better success rate for names, with an F-score of 0.582207840022 and a much better one for companies, with an F-Score of 0.508912602583. However, it takes much longer to run running in just under five minutes for all 183,000 names and 20 seconds for the companies.

I have shifted focus too companies rather than names, so I will not be recording name data for now. I also changed the program to pick 3 possibilities and recorded it as a match if any of the names match. 
I noticed that companies often take out or add spaces, and therefore developed a strategy where I remove all spaces in pre-proccesing and check if one name is a substring of another. Here is the data for that method:
possible matches: 25897
total names: 36629
not indexed: 16619
wrongly indexed: 2606.0
all false negitives: 19225.0
true positives: 17400.0
false positives: 2573.0
f-score 0.614862715997999
As you can see, 1/3 of the misses are from missbucketing, it is rare ( <10% of the possible matches) that none of the first three matches match.
